Analysis


Line Graphs:
By comparing COVID-19/H1N1 Cases and Deaths over Time in different countries we  determined who is currently doing ‘better’ or ‘worse’ during the pandemic. 
Based on this information future studies can evaluate why some countries might be doing better than others.
We selected only  6 countries due to limited data in both data sets. 

Linear regression: 
We used the linear regression to model the relationship between cases vs deaths for COVID-19 and H1N1. 
This will allowed us to see that there was a  strong correlation and relationship between pandemic cases and pandemic deaths. 

Graph:
We used a bar graph to evaluate which countries had a higher diabetes prevelance during the COVID-19 timeframe and compared it to the line graph of COVID-19 Cases to see if there would be a relationship between higher COVIID-19 cases in countries with higher diabetes prevelance. There wasnt. We were limited to using this method due to having only 1 data point for diabetes prevelance per country.


T-Test:
Our hypothesis was that COVID-19 has a higher transmission rate than H1N1.
The Null Hypothesis is that COVID-19 does not have a higher transmission rate than H1N1.
We test this hypothesis by comparing the average cases of COVID-19 and H1N1 in the independent T-test.
Our P value=0 therefore we can reject the null.
