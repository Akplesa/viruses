## Pandemics 
Pandemics have been documented all the way back from the mid sixth century AD [1] and have heavily impacted social, economic, and political aspects of human civilization. Through understanding pandemic trends we can better prepare our responses to future pandemics.
With limited data, we evaluate and compare several trends across 6 countries of the current COVID-19 pandemic we are experiencing . Furthermore, to better understand the severity of COVID-19 we compare cases and deaths between our recent COVID-19 pandemic and the prior H1N1 pandemic of 2009. 

## Process 

# Overview
R0 is the metric used to describe how contagious a disease is by estimating the ability of a pathogen to spread. Its defined as the average number of secondary transmissions from one infected person to another [1]. According to the  ‘Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza Pandemics’ study, by Esklid .P. et al , COVID-19 has a higher average transmissibility than the H1N1 virus.
