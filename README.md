## Pandemics 
Pandemics have been documented all the way back from the mid sixth century AD [1] and have heavily impacted social, economic, and political aspects of human civilization. Through understanding pandemic trends we can better prepare our responses to future pandemics.
With limited data, we evaluate and compare several trends across 6 countries of the current COVID-19 pandemic we are experiencing . Furthermore, to better understand the severity of COVID-19 we compare cases and deaths between our recent COVID-19 pandemic and the prior H1N1 pandemic of 2009. 

## Process 

# Overview:
R0 is the metric used to describe how contagious a disease is by estimating the ability of a pathogen to spread. Its defined as the average number of secondary transmissions from one infected person to another [1]. According to the  ‘Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza Pandemics’ study, by Esklid .P. et al , COVID-19 has a higher average transmissibility than the H1N1 virus.

# Hypothesis:
COVID-19 has a higher transmission rate than H1N1. We will test this hypothesis through various statistical analyses using pandmeic datasets found on Kaggle .

# COVID-19 vs H1N1: Rate of Cases:
By comparing COVID-19 ‘Cases over Time’ in different countries we can determine who is currently doing ‘better’ or ‘worse’ during the pandemic. 
Similarly, By evaluating H1N1 ‘Cases over Time’ for the SAME countries we can see if they show similar trends to our current COVID-19 pandemic. 
Based on this information future studies can evaluate why some countries might be doing better than others.
We selected only  6 countries due to limited data in both data sets. 

# COVID-19 vs H1N1: Death Trends:
By comparing COVID-19 death rates  in different countries we can better understand who is currently doing ‘better’ or ‘worse’ during the pandemic allowing future studies to further research and  understand why there might be more deaths in one country vs. the other. 
By comparing H1N1 death rates for the SAME countries we can now understand which virus lead to greater mortalities than the other. 

# COVID-19/H1N1: Linear Regression:
We use the linear regression to model the relationship between cases vs deaths for COVID-19 and for H1N1. 
This will allow us to see if there is a strong or weak positive or negative correlation between pandemic cases and deaths.
The R^2 value will show that the value% of variation in one variable may be explained by the other. 
We  believe that there will be a strong correlation and relationship between pandemic cases and deaths.
