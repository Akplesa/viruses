"1. See NIPA Handbook, Chapter 5: Personal Consumption Expenditures, for a detailed discussion of the concepts, source data, and estimating methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Food services and drinking places receipts are not included in the calculation of the retail control measure. Estimates of personal consumption expenditures for food services are prepared separately with data on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  food services and drinking places from the Census Bureau's Advance Monthly Retail Trade Survey.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. For more information, see FAQ 315 ""How is BEA using the Census Bureau's quarterly services survey in its estimates of personal consumption expenditures?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. Net expenses of NPISHs, defined as their gross operating expenses less primary sales to households",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. Gross output is net of unrelated sales, secondary sales, and sales to business, to government, and to the rest of the world; excludes own-account investment (construction and software).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. Excludes unrelated sales, secondary sales, and sales to business, to government, and to the rest of the world; includes membership dues and fees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7. See NIPA Handbook, Chapter 6: Fixed Investment, for a detailed discussion of the concepts, source data, and estimating methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2019, estimates for footage drilled in the third estimate reflect updated data from API that may not match API's published data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9. Other structures excludes brokers' commissions and net purchases of used structures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10. NIPA purchases of equipment and the Census shipments series differ primarily because the NIPA series cover only business purchases on capital account, including purchases of imported equipment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Census series include some current-account purchases, mainly parts; include purchases by government, rest of the world, and persons; and exclude imported equipment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11. Beginning with the ""advance"" estimate for the third quarter of 2011, the current quarterly estimates of private fixed investment in aircraft are based on data from the Census Bureau's Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  and Orders (M3) on nondefense aircraft shipments. Previously, the estimates were based on aircraft data from the Census Bureau's Current Industrial Report program, which was discontinued in 2011. For more information, see FAQ 1005.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12. The value of single-family structures put in place is estimated by Census using data on the number of 1-unit structures started in the current and earlier months; the value of multifamily structures put in place is directly measured.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13. See NIPA Handbook, Chapter 7: Change in Private Inventories, for a detailed discussion of the concepts, source data, and estimating methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14. NIPA estimates of change in private inventories for retail motor vehicle dealers are based on Census survey and trade source data on units produced and sold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15. Historical source data may reflect concurrent seasonal adjustment factors that are computed in conjunction with the GDP release.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"16. For the Census-basis series, data for the latest month are from the U.S. International Trade in Goods Advance Report, released by the Census Bureau, and data for the earlier months are from the U.S. International Trade ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  in Goods and Services Report, jointly released by the Census Bureau and BEA. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17. NIPA national defense consumption expenditures and gross investment differs from DOD military outlays in the Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS) primarily because of coverage and timing. The DOD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  outlays do not cover defense atomic energy-related expenditures by the Department of Energy or consumption of general government fixed capital; the NIPA measure covers these expenditures. The DOD outlays record all ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  transactions on a cash basis; the NIPA measure reflects gross investment in equipment on a delivery basis and compensation on an accrual basis. The NIPA measure is also adjusted to remove seasonal variation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  For more information, see FAQ 1018 “How does BEA use the Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS) to produce estimates of defense spending?” ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"18. NIPA nondefense consumption expenditures and gross investment differs from outlays other than DOD in the MTS primarily because of coverage. Outlays cover expenditures -- outlays for goods, services, and structures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  from business and from the rest of the world and compensation of federal government employees -- as well as government social benefits, grants-in-aid to state and local governments, other current transfer payments ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  to the rest of the world, interest paid, and subsidies. They also cover defense atomic energy-related expenditures by the Department of Energy, which are classified as NIPA national defense consumption expenditures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  The outlays do not include consumption of general government fixed capital, and the NIPA measure does. The NIPA measure is also adjusted to remove seasonal variation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"19. Employment cost index (ECI) for wages and salaries is published each year for the months of March, June, September, and December. The NIPAs use the ECI to derive quarterly estimates of state and local government compensation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"20. NIPA estimates of state and local structures investment are derived using seasonally-adjusted monthly Census data for most series and not-seasonally adjusted data for education, transportation, water, and conservation ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that are seasonally adjusted by BEA.  Consequently, BEA adjusted values may differ from those published by the Census Bureau.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
